# UofTHacks-X
exploration themed solo attempt?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Clone into the repository, maintain structure of template folder.

 2. Open the project in the choice of your IDE

 3. Run the Program, it will take a few moments depending on the hardware (the specific line is app.run() on line 33)

 4. IDE Console will generate an IP for a local host server of the type //127.0.0.1:<some number>/, click on this to open it in your browser.

 5. Add a query (activity) and a location where spots for the activity are searched. Click on experience (p.s. I know its cheesy)
  
 6. It will take some amount of time, which can probably be improved with future versions, or better trained models of Co:Here's AI
  
 7. Absence of queries might result in some interesting outputs?

 8. IMPORTANT: line 14 of explor.py contains the trial key given by co:here for the hackathon, if it doesn't work, try a newer key maybe. 
  
 9. Do Not. Try. Offiensive. Or. Profane. Queries.
